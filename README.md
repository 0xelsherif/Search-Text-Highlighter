# Search Text Highlighter

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for specific text within a paragraph and highlights all occurrences of the searched text.

## Features

- Input field to enter the text you want to search for.
- Clickable button to initiate the search.
- Automatic highlighting of all matches within the paragraph.
- Display of the number of matches found.
- Feedback message indicating whether any results were found.

## Instructions

1. Enter the text you want to search for in the input field labeled "Search...".
2. Click the "Search" button to initiate the search.
3. Matches will be highlighted in yellow within the paragraph.
4. The number of matches found will be displayed above the paragraph.
5. If no matches are found, a message in red will indicate this.

## How It Works

- The application uses JavaScript to perform a search within the paragraph element.
- It utilizes regular expressions to find all occurrences of the searched text, ignoring case sensitivity.
- Matches are then highlighted using HTML `<mark>` tags.
- The application provides visual feedback to the user based on the search results.
